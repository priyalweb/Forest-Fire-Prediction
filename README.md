# Forest-Fire-Prediction

Project Description: Analyzed a dataset collected from forests in the northeast region of Portugal with the utilization of FWI system. Firstly, we established relationships between the meteorological factors(e.g. temperatrue, relative humidity, wind) as well as model features(e.g. FFMC, DMC) correlated to forest fires. Having acquired the weights and influence of different factors on forest fires, We then applied the relationship to building a prediction system for forest fires. The system will calculate the parametrs input and give feedback on the probability of potential forest fires using SVM.
